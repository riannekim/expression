    <h1>
        When Will My Life Begin
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Mandy Moore
    </h2>
    <p class="line1">
        Seven a.m., the usual morning lineup
    </p>
    <p class="line2">
        Start on the chores and sweep 'till the floor's all clean
    </p>
    <p class="line3">
        Polish and wax, do laundry, and mop and shine up
    </p>
    <p class="line4">
        Sweep again, and by then it's like 7:15
    </p>
    <p class="line5">
        And so I'll read a book
    </p>    
    <p class="line6">
        Or maybe two or three
    </p>   
    <p class="line7">
        I'll add a few new paintings to my gallery
    </p>
    <p class="line8">
        I'll play guitar and knit
    </p> 
    <p class="line9">
        And cook and basically
    </p>    
    <p class="line10">
        Just wonder when will my life begin?
    </p>  
    <p class="line11">
        Then after lunch it's puzzles and darts and baking
    </p> 
    <p class="line12">
        Paper mache, a bit of ballet and chess
    </p>   
    <p class="line13">
        Pottery and ventriloquy, candle making
    </p>  
    <p class="line14">
        Then I'll stretch, maybe sketch, take a climb
    </p>  
    <p class="line15">
        Sew a dress!
    </p>  
    <p class="line16">
        And I'll reread the books
    </p> 
    <p class="line17">
        If I have time to spare
    </p>  
    <p class="line18">
        I'll paint the walls some more
    </p>   
    <p class="line19">
        I'm sure there's room somewhere
    </p>    
    <p class="line20">
        And then I'll brush and brush
    </p>   
    <p class="line21">
        And brush and brush my hair
    </p>   
    <p class="line22">
        Stuck in the same place I've always been
    </p>   
    <p class="line23">
        And I'll keep wanderin' and wanderin'
    </p>   
    <p class="line24">
        And wanderin' and wonderin'
    </p>    
    <p class="line25">
        When will my life begin?
    </p>    
    <p class="line26">
        And tomorrow night
    </p>   
    <p class="line27">
        The lights will appear
    </p>    
    <p class="line28">
        Just like they do on my birthday each year
    </p>    
    <p class="line29">
        What is it like
    </p>    
    <p class="line30">
        Out there where they glow?
    </p>   
    <p class="line31">
        Now that I'm older
    </p>   
    <p class="line32">
        Mother might just
    </p>    
    <p class="line33">
        Let me go
    </p>
